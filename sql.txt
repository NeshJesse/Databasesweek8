Popular Genres in Different Countries, we choose to skip null fields by WHERE

  SELECT country, genre, COUNT(*) AS genre_count
FROM netflix_titles
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY country, genre
ORDER BY country, genre_count DESC;

If i ran it without limit the result is 1179 rows SO i limited it to 15 rows:

SELECT country, genre, COUNT(*) AS genre_count
FROM netflix_titles
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY country, genre
ORDER BY country, genre_count DESC
LIMIT 15;
